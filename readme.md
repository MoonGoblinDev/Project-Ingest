## Description

Project Ingest streamlines the process of providing code to LLMs. It scans a project directory, lets you filter out irrelevant files, and consolidates all the code into a single, clean markdown file. This saves you from tedious manual copy-pasting and helps you make the most of your LLM's context window.

## Features

*   **üå≤ Interactive File Tree:** Visualize and browse your entire project structure.
*   **‚úÖ Smart Filtering:**
    *   Click any file or folder to instantly exclude or include it from the output.
    *   Use `.gitignore`-style patterns (e.g., `*.log`, `build/`) for advanced filtering.
*   **ü§ñ Accurate Token Counting:**
    *   Instantly see the token count for each file and the entire project total.
    *   Uses `Tiktoken` to calculate token using `gpt-4o` tokenizer.
*   **üèóÔ∏è Include Project Structure:** Optionally add a directory tree to the output to give the LLM better context.
*   **üöÄ Modern & Responsive:** Built with SwiftUI & Appkit, native macOS experience that handles large projects with ease.
*   **üìã Quick Output:**
    *   Copy the entire generated content to your clipboard with one click (‚åò+‚áß+C).
    *   Save the output as a markdown file (‚åò+S).
