# Privacy Policy for Project Ingest

**Last Updated:** July 6, 2024

Thank you for using Project Ingest ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains what information the App handles and how it is used. Your privacy is critically important to us.

## 1. No Personal Data Collection

Project Ingest is designed to work entirely on your device. We do not collect, store, transmit, or have access to any of your personal information. The App does not include user accounts, analytics, or advertising frameworks.

## 2. Information Handled by the App

The App works with files and folders that you explicitly select. All processing of your project files and content occurs locally on your Mac.

**a. File and Folder Access:**
The App requires you to select a source folder to function. All files within this folder are read and processed on your device. This content is **never** transmitted to us or any third party.

**b. Locally Stored Settings:**
To improve your experience, the App stores certain settings on your device using the standard macOS `UserDefaults` system. This includes:
- A list of recently opened folders (as secure bookmarks).
- Your custom "exclude" and "include" patterns for each project.

This information is stored only on your Mac and is used solely for the functionality of the App. You can clear the list of recent folders at any time from within the App.

## 3. Third-Party Services

**Tiktoken Library:**
The App uses the Tiktoken library to calculate token counts for your code. The first time you use a specific model (e.g., "gpt-4o"), this library may need to download encoding definition files from a content delivery network (CDN) managed by OpenAI.

This is a one-time process for each model and is necessary for the tokenization feature to work. During this process, **none of your project files, code, or personal data is transmitted.** Only a request for the generic encoding file is made.

## 4. How Your Information Is Used

The information handled by the App is used exclusively to provide the App's core features:
- To build the file tree of your selected project.
- To filter files based on your include/exclude rules.
- To read file contents for ingestion and token counting.
- To remember recent folders for your convenience.

## 5. Security

We take your privacy seriously. Since all your project data and settings remain on your device, you maintain full control. We rely on the security measures provided by Apple's macOS operating system.

## 6. Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any information from children under the age of 13.

## 7. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically for any changes.
